# SOC-Home-Lab

In this Repo, I will show the steps I followed to build a SOC Home Lab on my computer.

### Abstract

The project describes setting up a cybersecurity home lab with an emphasis on monitoring and detection. It gives me a realistic setting in which to configure, secure, and monitor an IT infrastructure, allowing me to put newly newly acquired knowledge to work in actual situations. The components consist of a Kali Linux machine for attacking, pfSense firewall, Snort IDS, Windows Server as a domain controller, and Splunk for log management. The project places a strong emphasis on practical instruction and risk-free cybersecurity exploration.

### My Computer

I built the lab on a DELL Latitude 5520 laptop. It had the following configuration.
* Intel Core I5-1135G7 processor
* 16 GB of memory
* 512 GB NNMe
